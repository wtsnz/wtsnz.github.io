			<h3>Tides NZ</h3>
			<p>Tides NZ was a project I did for myself over two weeks. I found myself interested in finding out when high and low tide would be – I went through a phase of skimboarding – and felt that some of the existing tide apps didn’t do it as well as I’d like. After many sleepless nights over that two week uni holiday, Tides NZ was created.</p>
			<p>Tides NZ has consitantly been Ranked #1 Navigation app for iPhone in the New Zealand app store since launch on the 1st May 2012 and is rated 4.5 stars with 117 ratings! Check it out below!</p>
