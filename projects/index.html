			<p>Tides NZ started as a personal app that helped me and my mates work out the best time to go skimboarding. A few others saw it, and asked if they could get it. So during the two week semester break, I locked myself away and made it into something I wouldn't mind putting my name to!</p>
			<p>Tides NZ was a project I did for myself over two weeks. I found myself interested in finding out when high and low tide would be – I went through a phase of skimboarding – and felt that some of the existing tide apps didn’t do it as well as I’d like. After many sleepless nights over that two week uni holiday, Tides NZ was created.</p>
			<p>Tides NZ has consistantly been Ranked #1 Navigation app for iPhone in the New Zealand app store since launch on the 1st May 2012 and is rated 4.5 stars with 166 ratings! Check it out below!</p> -->
