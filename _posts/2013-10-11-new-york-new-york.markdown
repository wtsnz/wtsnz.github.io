Two weeks ago I was in New York. It was amazing. The city is just as crazy as in the films and I enjoyed every moment, even though I was there for "work".

[Me](http://twitter.com/vfxguynz/), [Leanne](http://twitter.com/LeeClarry) and [Nic](http://twitter.com/gibbini) were the lucky ones from [PaperKite](http://paperkite.co.nz) that were invited to go and launch the UN Handbook app to our clients, the NZUN. We had a great time meeting the people over in New York that work for the New Zealand consulate, and we had a blast. 

We did all the tourist things apart from going to the Statue of Liberty, and managed to take some amazing photos!

There were a few highlights to the trip for myself

* Going around the UN Building
* Having lunch in the New York Facebook HQ! Their office is awesome. Vending machines with pc equiptment in them. What?!
* Hanging out with some of the [GitHub](https://github.com) guys at Beercade in Brooklyn, and meeting a few people from awesome tech startups!

Anyway check out the UN Hanbook on the [Apple App Store](http://www.appstore.com/UNHandbook) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=govt.nz.mfat.UNHandbook) and don't forget to leave a rating!
