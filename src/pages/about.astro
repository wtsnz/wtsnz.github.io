              🚢 I enjoy shipping great software, learning how to write clean
              code, and creating great user experiences using Swift (previously
              Objective-C).

          <p>
            I’ve tinkered with computers for as long as I remember and,
            naturally, that&apos;s led me down a path that&apos;s gotten me into
            the tech industry. Over the last decade I&apos;ve worked at a bunch
            of great companies and worked on a large variety of projects,
            products and technologies. I&apos;ve found a niche developing on
            Apple platforms in the industry that I thorougly enjoy, and met some
            great people along the way.
          </p>
