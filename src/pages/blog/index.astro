          <p>
            There&apos;s always a lot more to consider than code when it comes to
            digital products. The projects below have been a great way for me to
            experience, and be in charge of the full lifecycle of product
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project I&apos;m most proud of was the app that started my App Store
            Career, Tides NZ. It has enjoyed being the #1 Navigation app in New
            Zealand since it&apos;s release in May 2011. As far as I can tell its
            since saturated the NZ market of people looking for Tide
            Predictions, received 500+ ratings with an average rating of 4.8,
            and gave me a little bit of pocket money.

        <h2>Work</h2>

        <p>
          I’ve tinkered with computers for as long as I remember and, naturally,
          that&apos;s led me down a path that&apos;s gotten me into the tech
          industry. Over the last decade I&apos;ve worked at a bunch of great
          companies and worked on a large variety of projects, products and
          technologies. I&apos;ve found a niche developing on Apple platforms in
          the industry that I thorougly enjoy, and met some great people along
          the way.
