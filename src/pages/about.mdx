# About

Iâ€™m a passionate, driven, self taught iOS developer, with a focus on shipping great software, writing clean code and creating great user experiences using Swift (previously Objective-C).

I wore several hats at PaperKite between March 2013 - July 2017. I spent the majority of time developing iOS applications for a wide variety of clients and use cases.

I was lucky enough to be interviewed for the Swift Coders podcast last year. You can [listen to the podcast](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/53-will-townsend-ios-team-lead-at-paperkite/) for an in-depth history of how I ended up here!

I have experience in unusual iOS architectures using MVVM, RxSwift, VIPER and the [Coordinator Pattern](/2016/an-ios-coordinator-pattern).
