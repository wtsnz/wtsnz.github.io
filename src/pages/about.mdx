# About

I'm not too sure what to write here after writing the blurb on the index page. Maybe that paragraph should go here, and then this should be deleted. I don't know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Here's some more random stuff:

- I was born in England, grew up in New Zealand, and now I live in Canada.
- I enjoy shipping great software, learning how to write clean code, and
creating great user experiences using Swift (previously Objective-C).
- I took a year off to _'travel the world'_ and chill out halfway through 2017 - 2018.
- I was interviewed for the Swift Coders podcast a while back. You can [listen to the
podcast](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/53-will-townsend-ios-team-lead-at-paperkite/) for an in-depth history of how
I ended up here!
- I have experience in unusual iOS architectures using MVVM, RxSwift, VIPER and the [Coordinator
Pattern](/2016/an-ios-coordinator-pattern).
- I've [high-fived Paul Mccartney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUsj6-PlDk8) ‚úã

## Work history

While I've been writing software since I remember, I've so far been employed by two brilliant companies where I've been able to work and learn from some fantastic people.

I joined PaperKite as the first full-time engineering hire. I wore a bunch of hats over the 5 years; I helped build products for our clients, build out the technical team, and over the 5 years, grow from 3 employees to 24. 
I learned a lot from a bunch of incredible people who's path I crossed, and I'll never forget the experience.

In terms of iOS projects, I worked on creating around 30 Objective-C & Swift based iOS applications for wide variety of clients and use cases.

## Will's Yearly Challenge‚Ñ¢ 

I hate new years resolutions. People always say they're going to change for the better, then do what they said for a few weeks, and then always seem to fall back into their old _bad_ habbits. 

But hey, habbits die hard, I tell myself that whenever I look down at my very own finger nails - or whats left of them - so who am I to blame anyone else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

What I can do however, is, rather than make a new years resolution that I stop doing after February, I set myself yearly challenges. These can vary from effort, ideally something small and something that I can do consistently.

| Year      |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2019 | Weekly Journal |
| 2018      | The Month Project, an Audio track every month       |
| 2014 - 2017   | Instagram, a photo every day.         |


### 2019 - Weekly Journal

I've always wanted to be _okay_ at writing. It's something that I feel that I've spent enough time improving since I left school (Twitter doesn't count) and it's something that I feel is important to be able to do well.

I've read a lot about journaling and it's benefits and I've tried to start a daily journal in the past, but it never really stuck as a habbit. This was probably because I went from nothing, to aiming to write every single day. It's hard to quickly make a change like that as it feels like too much effort. So rather than start this year by saying that I'm going to write daily, I'm going to attempt to introduce the habbit over a longer time by starting with Weekly entries.

This doesn't need to be a massive entry, but just sit down for 15 minutes at the end of the week - every Sunday night - and write everything that comes out of me.

I feel like this may produce similar results in a years time, to when I posted a photo on Instagram everyday in 2014-17. It's a great reminder to see how far you've come, to see your personal growth.

Wish me luck.

### 2018 - The Month Project, An audio track every month


I've been tinkering with the guitar and music product for a few years now, but haven't actually finished anything. This
year will change that.

I'm going to release, finished or not, a piece of audio/track evey month.

You can follow progress on [the YouTube playlist
here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuSt_4dhCk5Qv0gihdL1KjB3C8Qqh4RYP), Apple Music, or listen on Spotify below



### 2014 - 2017 - Instagram, a photo every day

https://www.instagram.com/wtsnz/

This was the first project, and it started accidentally. I started posting one picture per day, and then I realised it
was near September and I'd been doing it since the first of Jan. It so was incredible to look back on and see what
you'd been up to that I decided to keep going.

In 2017 I made the conscious decision to take a photo every day. I knew that this would be a big year for me as I had a
lot of travel plans. I went all over Europe, the USA and visited Canada during the second half of the year after
leaving my job! This is crazy to look back on, in a great way.
