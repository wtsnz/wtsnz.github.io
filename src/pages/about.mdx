# About

Here's a couple of things that you might not know about me:

- 🌎 I was born in England, grew up in New Zealand and now I live in Canada 
- 🚢 I enjoy shipping great software, learning how to write clean code, and
creating great user experiences using Swift (previously Objective-C).
- ✈️ I took a year off to _'travel the world'_ and recover from burnout out halfway through 2017 - 2018.
- 🎙 I was interviewed for the Swift Coders podcast a while back. You can [listen to the
podcast](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/53-will-townsend-ios-team-lead-at-paperkite/) for an in-depth history of how
I ended up here!
- 🏗 I have experience in unusual iOS architectures using MVVM, RxSwift, VIPER and the [Coordinator
Pattern](/2016/an-ios-coordinator-pattern).
- ✋ I've [high-fived Paul Mccartney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUsj6-PlDk8) ✋
- 👨‍💻 Started my indie software journey in 2020
- 🎸 I'm learning to play chords on the guitar

## Work history

While I've been writing software since I remember, I've so far been employed by two brilliant companies where I've been able to work and learn from some fantastic people.

I've done it, I've gone indie! Started a studio to continue working on apps and hardware. I've got big plans and am excited about this step.

  role="iOS Developer"
>

After moving to Vancouver, BC, I managed to land a job at an agency that I've admired from afar for a while. The people I work with here are 👌

<br />

I worked on a bunch of projects during my time at MetaLab. It was a very hard decision to leave because of what we worked on, the people and the mindset.

<WorkPlace 
  link="https://paperkite.co.nz"
  date="2012 - 2017" 
  name="PaperKite"
  image={logoPaperKite}
  role="iOS Technical Lead"
>

I joined PaperKite as the first full-time engineering hire. I wore a bunch of hats over the 5 years; I helped build products for our clients, build out the technical team, and over the 5 years, grow from 3 employees to 24. 
I learned a lot, and I'll never forget the experience.

<br />

In terms of iOS projects, I worked on creating around 30 Objective-C & Swift based iOS applications for wide variety of clients and use cases.
