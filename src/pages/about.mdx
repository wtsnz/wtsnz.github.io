# About

Here's some more random stuff:

- 🌎 I was born in England, grew up in New Zealand and now I live in Canada 
- 🚢 I enjoy shipping great software, learning how to write clean code, and
creating great user experiences using Swift (previously Objective-C).
- ✈️ I took a year off to _'travel the world'_ and chill out halfway through 2017 - 2018.
- 🎙 I was interviewed for the Swift Coders podcast a while back. You can [listen to the
podcast](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/53-will-townsend-ios-team-lead-at-paperkite/) for an in-depth history of how
I ended up here!
- 🏗 I have experience in unusual iOS architectures using MVVM, RxSwift, VIPER and the [Coordinator
Pattern](/2016/an-ios-coordinator-pattern).
- ✋ I've [high-fived Paul Mccartney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUsj6-PlDk8) ✋
- 👨‍💻 Started my indie software journey in 2020

I joined PaperKite as the first full-time engineering hire. I wore a bunch of hats over the 5 years; I helped build products for our clients, build out the technical team, and over the 5 years, grow from 3 employees to 24. 
I learned a lot, and I'll never forget the experience.

<br />

In terms of iOS projects, I worked on creating around 30 Objective-C & Swift based iOS applications for wide variety of clients and use cases.

## Will's Yearly Challenge™ 

I dislike new years resolutions. People always say they're going to change for the better, then do what they said for a few weeks, and then always seem to fall back into their old _bad_ habbits. 

But hey, habbits die hard, I tell myself that whenever I look down at my very own finger nails - or whats left of them - so who am I to blame anyone else 🤷‍♂️.

What I can do however, is, rather than make a new years resolution that I stop doing after February, I set myself yearly challenges. These can vary from effort, ideally something small and something that I can do consistently.

| Year      |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2019 | Weekly Journal |
| 2018      | The Month Project, an Audio track every month       |
| 2014 - 2017   | Instagram, a photo every day.         |
