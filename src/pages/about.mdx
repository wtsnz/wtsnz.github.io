# About

I'm not too sure what to write here after writing the blurb on the index page. Maybe that paragraph should go here, and then this should be deleted. I don't know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Here's some more random stuff:

- I was born in England, grew up in New Zealand, and now lives in Canada.
- I enjoy shipping great software, writing clean code and
creating great user experiences using Swift (previously Objective-C).
- I took a year off to _'travel the world'_ and chill out in 2017.
- I was lucky enough to be interviewed for the Swift Coders podcast last year. You can [listen to the
podcast](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com/e/53-will-townsend-ios-team-lead-at-paperkite/) for an in-depth history of how
I ended up here!
- I have experience in unusual iOS architectures using MVVM, RxSwift, VIPER and the [Coordinator
Pattern](/2016/an-ios-coordinator-pattern).

## Work history

While I've been writing software since I remember, I've so far been employed by two brilliant companies where I've been able to work and learn from some fantastic people.

I joined PaperKite as the first full-time engineering hire. I wore a bunch of hats over the 5 years; I helped build products for our clients, build out the technical team, and over the 5 years, grow from 3 employees to 24. 
I learned a lot from a bunch of incredible people who's path I crossed, and I'll never forget the experience.

<br />

In terms of iOS projects, I worked on creating around 30 Objective-C & Swift based iOS applications for wide variety of clients and use cases.

### Yearly Challenge

Rather than make new years resolution that I stop doing after February, I set myself yearly challenges.


#### 2018 - The Month Project, An audio track every month

I've been tinkering with the guitar and music product for a few years now, but haven't actually finished anything. This
year will change that.

I'm going to release, finished or not, a piece of audio/track evey month.

You can follow progress on [the YouTube playlist
here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuSt_4dhCk5Qv0gihdL1KjB3C8Qqh4RYP), Apple Music, or listen on Spotify below

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/PLuSt_4dhCk5Qv0gihdL1KjB3C8Qqh4RYP" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

<SpotifyPlayer
  uri="spotify:playlist:2GEg08FsPmj7y6eNoStRvo"
  size={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 500,
  }}
/>

#### 2014 - 2017 - Instagram, a photo every day

This was the first project, and it started accidentally. I started posting one picture per day, and then I realised it
was near September and I'd been doing it since the first of Jan. It so was incredible to look back on and see what
you'd been up to that I decided to keep going.

In 2017 I made the concious descision to take a photo every day. I knew that this would be a big year for me as I had a
lot of travel plans. I went all over Europe, the USA and visited Canada during the second half of the year after
leaving my job! This is crazy to look back on, in a great way.
