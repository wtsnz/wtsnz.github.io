Back in May, I was invited to talk on the [Swift Coders Podcast](https://swiftcoders.podbean.com). The host Garric and I began talking after the events of [8 November 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016), when he suddenly felt the need to seek opportunities outside of the US.

Anyway... we managed to sort out a time that worked for us both. Being in LA and Wellington the differences in timezones didn't end up being too bad. I managed to get up early, neck a coffee and be awake and alert for the 9 am interview! ‚òïÔ∏è

We talked about how I got into the industry, how I come up with ideas for my app (solve my own pain points) and talked about Swift. I‚Äôd never done anything like this before - my voice sounds awful when I listen back to the recording! 

Garric is a great host so I quickly felt a bit more comfortable, and ended up feeling pretty good about it. After it was over!

It's now had over ~~3.7k~~ 5k downloads which blows my mind. ü§Ø
