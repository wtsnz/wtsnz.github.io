Another year has passed. After realising how much I enjoyed writing my [2013](https://will.townsend.io/2013/2013-in-review/) post I did this time last year I've decided to do it again for this past year.

I don't keep a diary, never have. Although I decided to try something different this year; I decided to take a picture everyday and post it to my Instagram account. This proved challenging at times, and took a bit of getting used to but I've found it later insightful as to how I spend my time! (Many days it was easy to take a picture of food, but hey, eating is important for survival!) [Check out my instagram feed here](http://instagram.com/wtsnz/)

Here's my random highlights from the year:
