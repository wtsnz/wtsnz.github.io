It's out! I finally managed to sit down for a few weekends and create the next version of Tides.

I've released the long awaited update to Tides NZ today. It's a complete rework, with new design and a couple more features. It's a free update to the existing app, though I decided against releasing it as a seperate app.

I probably could have released it as a new app, but what the hell.

## Design
I am pretty proud of the design. It's gone completely 'clean', away from the previous tweetbot-esque look that was so popular prior to iOS7. 

Lot's of transparency, blurryness and whites. It was challenging to continue to look at the screen at 2am.

I've continued to use the picture flow technique for the app store pictures, check them out on the [app store page](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/tides-nz/id521561961?mt=8).

I am very happy with the way that the [Tides NZ website](http://tidesapp.co.nz) turned out. I spent a few days tweaking everything to try to follow the same style as the app. This was the second responsive site that actually works that I've made using twitter bootstrap.

## Dev

This new app took me about 4 weekends from start to finish. That's 8 days working about 5-6 hours a day. So around 48 hours to blank project to submission, including website. That's a lot of time, I think.

It was amazing to go through my original code that I wrote for the first time just over a year and a half ago. My first ever finished iOS app.

<em>I've learned a hell of a lot over the last year and a half, and it's been amazing.</em> I love creating software for the iOS platform, it's amazing, even if it's a little repetative - Every app is just wiring up tableviews.

I had the original code to base everything off, so that helped speed things up. I tidied up the data loading classes, and made them a lot neater. 

I've also added Pods, and made use of a selection of open source libraries. I would love to give back to the community at some point in the near future.

## Future

I can't wait to see how every responds to the update. I hope you all enjoy it. So [check it out!](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/tides-nz/id521561961?mt=8)
