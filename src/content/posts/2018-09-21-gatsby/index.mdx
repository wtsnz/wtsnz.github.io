Say hello to the new blog! 

I know that every month a new blogging engine is released, and that continually switching to the latest and greatest could almost be considered a developer sport these days. This time, though, I swear it's _different_!

Why change?

I remember the first website that blew me away - Brett Victors Worrydream and his article on the [Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction) (If you haven't yet heard of this, go check it out right now). It was for two reasons; 

Interactive content with interesting, complex topic. The great thing was that the interactive elements help you grasp the topic and help you understand the core concepts.

- React 
  - Ever since first playing around with React on the web my mind has been blown. Compoenents are such a great way to represent the building blocks that a user interface is made up of. Mixed with state, you have everything you need to make very complicated interfaces very easily.

Another fun little one is the live reload functionality. Seeing a rendered preview of the post after saving the file is awesome.

I was convinced to switch after coming across the MDX format. 

When I first came across gatsby, it was a year or so ago, and I enjoyed the fact that it was based on React. Specifically components.
