I've just released a [Hoist iOS library](https://github.com/wtsnz/Hoist) on github.

[Hoist Apps](http://hoistapps.com/) are a Wellington based startup that's been recieving a [lot](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/02/04/hoist-aims-make-web-applications-easy-anyone-develop/) of [attention](http://builtinwellington.com/speedcurve-hoist-take-honours-webstock-startup-alley/) recently.

I'm really interested in what they are doing, and expect great things from them even though they have a few big competitors in the Platform-as-a-Service space. ([Parse.com](https://parse.com/), [Dropbox Datastore](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore), [Hood.ie](http://hood.ie/) and many more)

As it's so close to home, I've taken some time to have a play around with the beta. The last few nights I've put a little something together for any iOS developers out there that might be interested in Hoist.

You can integrate it into your next iOS project by simply adding the following to your Podfile

	pod "Hoist"
	
Publish a CocoaPod life goal complete!
