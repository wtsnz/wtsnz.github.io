import Gist from 'components/Gist'

Last week was Amazon's first summit in Auckland, PaperKite decided to take the team up to Auckland for the day to see what it was all about. We had a great time and was provided with a great insight about all the services that AWS provides.

Once we got back, over the long weekend due to the Queen's Birthday I had a play with a few node.js app's and hosting it on EC2.

This is more for me that a tutorial on how to do so, but it's here anyway.
I'm assuming you have a brand new instance of Amazon Linux running and have logged in for the first time.

I may post about how to set up nginx nodejs proxy-ing in the future!
