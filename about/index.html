<h1>About</h1>
<p>I drink a lot of tea, I like to code and when I'm in the right mood I enjoy design/art. I've recently been toying with a couple of languages that can be used to make web applications - Ruby, Go and Node.js. Which I've found to be a lot of fun and may help to bring some of my wacky product ideas to life.</p>
<p>I'm also into game design (who isn't), which is how it all started for me back when flash games were a thing. I've got a few prototype games that I've got on my iPhone that I must get around to releasing. So watch this space.</p>
<p>I've started to play guitar, after getting inspired by Ed Sheeran. Maybe one day I'll try and sing. what.</p>

<h1>A Brief History</h1>
<p>I was <b>made in England</b> around Jan 1992 and have been <b>living in New Zealand since 2006</b>. I aspired to become somebody in the film/visual effects industry (hence my twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/vfxguynz">@vfxguynz</a>) and uploaded a few videos to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WTStudios">youtube channel</a>. To my suprise one video has 100,000+ views! I lost interest in the 3D Animation course I attended as I started creating games for the HP Touchpad (<a href="http://developer.palm.com/blog/2011/11/weekly-app-hack-winner-2/">and won the HP WebOS Weekly App Hack!</a>).</p>
<p>After that, I decided to go to Auckland University and <b>try my luck at a CompSci Degree</b>. I lived about an hours ferry journey away, so I decided to purchase a Mac Book Pro because the battery life was much better than most competing laptops and would last me the day.</p>
<p>This has ended up becoming one of the most pivotal moments of my life so far, as <b>buying that MacBook enabled me to download xcode</b>. After playing around with the Cocoa Touch SDK on the ferry, I got the idea for my <b>first app, Tides NZ</b> and managed to get the first version released during the first two week uni break. It went of to be a better success that I could have imagined and solidified my decision to become a <b>software engineer.</b></p>
<p>Soon after meeting up with a few developers in Auckland, through word of mouth I landed an <b>iOS contract down in Wellington</b> for a couple of weeks which has <b>lead into my current full time position at <a href="http://paperkite.co.nz" target="_blank">PaperKite</a></b>.</p>
<p>I've was also lucky enough to be selected for <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0f/Time_youcover01.jpg">Time Magazine's Person of the Year in 2006</a>.</p>
