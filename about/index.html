<p>I wore several hats at <a href="http://paperkite.co.nz">PaperKite</a> between March 2013 - July 2017. I spent the majority of time developing iOS applications for a wide variety of clients and use cases.</p>

<!-- <p>I drink a lot of tea, I like to code and when I'm in the right mood I enjoy to play around with music. Which I've found to be a lot of fun and may help to bring some of my wacky ideas to life.</p>
<p>I play guitar.</p> -->

<h1>Yearly Challenge</h1>

<p>Rather than make new years resolution that I stop doing after February, since 2014 I've set myself yearly challenges.</p>

<h2>2018 - The Month Project</h2>
<h4>A track every month</h4>

<p>I've been tinkering with the guitar and music product for a few years now, but haven't actually finished anything. This year will change that.</p>
<p>I'm going to release, finished or not, a piece of audio/track evey month.</p>

<h2>2017 - Instagram, a photo every day</h2>

<p>In 2017 I made the concious descision to take a photo every day. I knew that this would be a big year for me as I had a lot of travel plans. I went all over Europe, the USA and visited Canada during the second half of the year after leaving my job! This is crazy to look back on, in a great way.</p>

<br />

<h2>2014 - Instagram, a photo every day</h2>

<p>This was the first project, and it started accidentally. I started posting one picture per day, and then I realised it was near September and I'd been doing it since the first of Jan. It so was incredible to look back on and see what you'd been up to that I decided to keep going.</p>
