I find playing Guitar is a great way to unwind after a good days worth of coding.

I've been playing for about a year now and I love it. I'm really, really good at playing the same 4 chords over and over again - just ask my flatmates.

To attempt to remedy this, I've started to learn a lot more theory, with the hope that I'll be able to better my improv skills. I don't yet fully understand all the theory, and am in no position to teach anyone, but the more I read, the more musical theory makes sense.

I've found this great video on YouTube which has taught me the basics.

There is a [PDF](https://guitarlessons365.com/scores/dec2009/3-Notes-Per-String-Major.pdf) that accompanies the video too.

I've just managed to memorise all of the shapes over the last week or so, practice, practice and more practice!

When I feel more comfortable moving up and down the neck, there is the major pentatonic and minor scales to learn. Until then
