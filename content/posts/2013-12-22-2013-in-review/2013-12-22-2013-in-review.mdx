2013 has officially been the craziest year of my life, so far. I managed to do lot's of things that three years ago I would have never imagined possible.

Some of the highlights

* January 
	- Kicked off the New Year at Rythm and Vines, something I'm glad I did, but something that I won't be doing again.
	- Won a golden ticket to get to go to Kim Dotcom's MEGA launch party!
	- Worked PaperKite for 6 weeks.
	- Re-designed my website.
* February
	- Decided not to go back to Auckland University and accepted permanent job offer at [PaperKite](http://paperkite.co.nz) as an iOS Developer instead.
* April
	- Went to Brisbane for a week.
* May
	- Moved into a tiny apartment at Soho Apartments Wellington CBD.
	- Started work on [Pushie](http://pushie.co.nz)
* June
	- Got VDSL, which ended up being slower than expected.
	- Went to TEDxTeAro
* August
	- Went to Perth for a week.
* September
	- Turned 21.
	- Went to New York for two weeks.
* October
	- Became Tech Lead at [PaperKite](http://paperkite.co.nz)
	- Moved into flat #2 at Mt Victoria, Wellington. Much bigger place.
	- Re-designed my website again, and 'promised' to write a post at least once per month.
* November
	- Released [Tides NZ 3.0](http://tidesapp.co.nz)
	- Went to Rarotonga for a week.
	- Went to Sydney for 10 hours
	- Re-wrote what I had of [Pushie](http://pushie.co.nz) so I could get it moving again.
* December
	- Finished up my (nearly) first year of full time work!

What a year!

Next year I would like to do a few things. Mainly, update my other Tides Apps (US, AUS and UK) to 3.0, Ship [Pushie](http://pushie.co.nz) and ship another project I've started.
