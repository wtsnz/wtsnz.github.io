<h1>Hey</h1>


<p>I'm a software developer currently living in Windy Wellington, New Zealand. I create <a href="https://github.com/wtsnz" target="_blank">software</a> for the devices that live in your pocket using Objective-C, Javascript, Ruby, Go, and recently Swift. I adore clean code and beautiful design with a nice cup of tea.</p>

<p>I'm the Technical Lead at <a href="http://paperkite.co.nz">PaperKite</a>, where I've worked for the last 2 years, learned an insane amount, and have been involved with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/all-blacks-the-rugby-union-app/id374882187?mt=8" target="_blank">some</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/metservice/id525900888?mt=8" target="_blank">awesome</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/randstad-timesheets/id785021889?mt=8" target="_blank">projects</a> - with a lot more in the works!</p>

<p>I'm attempting to <a href="/blog">blog</a> more. Here's my last five posts.</p>

<h1>Personal Projects</h1>
<p>I get a kick out of making things, so it doesn't stop when I get home. I'd love to make something that people love to use. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/wtsnz" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page to see what I've been up to recently.</p>
<p>My product journey so far has been extremely educational. There's so much more to consider than a few lines of code! The most successful personal project of mine <a href="http://tidesapp.co.nz">Tides NZ</a>, has been a great success and has enjoyed being the #1 Navigation app in New Zealand since it's release in May 2011!</p>

			<h3><a href="http://tidesapp.co.nz" target="_blank">Tides NZ</a></h3>
			<p>Tides NZ was the first iOS app I created. I got the idea through a summer of skimboarding, which knowing what the tide was doing was essential for me and my mates.</p>

			<h3><a href="http://getsalesapp.com" target="_blank">Sales</a></h3>
			<p>After launching Tides NZ, I came accross AppFigures. While they don't have a companion app, they do provide a public API for third parties to play with. Hence Sales was born.</p>

<p>Things that haven't ended up in the AppStore.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/wtsnz/NZHerald" target="_blank">Alternate NZ Herald Client</a></h3>
			<p>I decided to reverse engineer the NZ Herald API and attempt to make a simple news client that replicates Medium's fantastic app (especially the scrolling).</p>
