<h1>Getting Started: Using the plugin</h1>

<p>Using the OBS iOS Camera plugin is easy. Once you have the plugin installed and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/obs-studio-iphone-video-source/id1352834008?ls=1&ct=Landing%20Page&mt=8">iOS app</a> installed:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Download and install the <a href="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source/releases">OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin</a></li>
	<li>Connect your iOS device to your computer.</li>
	<li>Open the OBS Stream App on your iPhone.</li>
	<li>Open OBS Studio on your computer.</li>
	<li>Add a new "iOS Camera" source to your scene.</li>
	<li>Use your iOS device as a webcam and stream your heart out! ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
</ol>

<p>Plugging in your iOS device with the app running automatically connects to OBS Studio.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>How can I change the output resolution?</h3>
<p>You can select the video resolution that your iPhone sends to OBS by tapping on the settings button.</p>
<p>Be careful though, higher resolutions and framerates can cause undesirable lag. I'd recommend streaming using either 720p@60 or 1080p@30. Future updates will allow you to configure the bitrate to allow streaming of higher resolutions and framerates if people desire this feature.</p>

<h3>OBS Studio crashed after plugging in my iPhone</h3>
<p>If OBS crashes after adding the iPhone Camera source to your scene, try again and make sure to follow the instructions at the top of this page. I've experienced this issue and it always works the second time - I know this isn't good enough, and I'm looking into the cause of this issue.</p>

<h3>I'm on Windows and my iOS device isn't connecting</h3>
<p>Make sure you've installed iTunes. On Windows iTunes provides the service to communicate to your iOS device over USB. iTunes doesn't need to be running, it needs to have been installed and ran once.</p>
