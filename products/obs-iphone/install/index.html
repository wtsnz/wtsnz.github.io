<h2>FAQs</h2>

<h3>I want to get rid of "Waiting for Connection" and "Settings" from the video stream</h3>
<p>You see something along the lines of this after adding the iOS Camera source in OBS Studio:</p>

</p>
<p>If you see this, the iOS Camera plugin hasn't loaded correctly. There was an issue in version 1.0.0 of the plugin that caused this issue on Mac's. <b>This is now fixed in version 1.1.0 of the plugin. I am sorry about this issue. Please redownload the installer from <a href="https://github.com/wtsnz/obs-ios-camera-source/releases">here</a> to install the updated OBS Studio plugin. ðŸ˜ƒ</b></p>

<h3>How can I change the output resolution?</h3>
<p>You can select the video resolution that your iPhone sends to OBS by tapping on the settings button.</p>
<p>Be careful though, higher resolutions and framerates can cause undesirable lag. I'd recommend streaming using either 720p@60 or 1080p@30. Future updates will allow you to configure the bitrate to allow streaming of higher resolutions and framerates if people desire this feature.</p>

<h3>OBS Studio crashed after plugging in my iPhone</h3>
<p>If OBS crashes after adding the iPhone Camera source to your scene, try again and make sure to follow the instructions at the top of this page. I've experienced this issue and it always works the second time - I know this isn't good enough, and I'm looking into the cause of this issue.</p>

<hr />

<h3>I'm on Windows and my iOS device isn't connecting</h3>
<p>Make sure you've installed iTunes. On Windows iTunes provides the service to communicate to your iOS device over USB. iTunes doesn't need to be running, it needs to have been installed and ran once.</p>
