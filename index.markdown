I'm a __software engineer__ currently living in Windy Wellington, New Zealand. I create [software](https://github.com/wtsnz) for the Apple devices that live in your pocket using __Swift__ and __Objective-C__. I adore __clean code__, __beautiful design__ and a perfectly brewed __cup of tea__ ‚òïÔ∏è.

I'm the Technical Lead at [PaperKite](http://paperkite.co.nz), where I've been since March 2013, and have been involved with projects of all shapes and sizes. Being a service company we're lucky enough to play with a lot of new (_and old!_) technology and create apps that an incredible amount of people use everyday üéâ.

# Writing

When I have nothing to do I sometime ramble about things on my [blog](/blog). Maybe one day there will be something of use to you. Here's my latest posts.

# Personal Projects

I get a kick out of making things, so it doesn't stop when I get home. I'd love to make something that people love to use. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/wtsnz) page to see what I've been up to recently.

My product journey so far has been extremely educational. There's so much more to consider than a few lines of code! The most successful personal project of mine <a href="http://tidesapp.co.nz">Tides NZ</a>, has been a great success and has enjoyed being the #1 Navigation app in New Zealand since it's release in May 2011!

			<h3><a href="http://tidesapp.co.nz" target="_blank">Tides NZ</a></h3>
			<p>Tides NZ was the first iOS app I created. I got the idea through a summer of skim-boarding, which knowing what the tide was doing was essential for me and my mates.</p>

			<p>After launching Tides NZ, I came across AppFigures. While they don't have a companion app, they do provide a public API for third parties to play with. Hence Sales was born.</p>

			<p>I decided to reverse engineer the NZ Herald API and attempt to make a simple news client that replicates Medium's fantastic app (especially the scrolling).</p>

			<p>I came across Sketch.js and a <a href="http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/examples/particles.html">Particle demo</a>. I quite liked it so spent an hour or so to implement (port js really..) something similar in Swift. It brought back memories of writing games in action script.</p>
